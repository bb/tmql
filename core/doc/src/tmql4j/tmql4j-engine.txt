=== Design patterns ===

==== Architecture ====

The TMQL4J engine offers a new abstraction layer on top of the TMAPI. Instead of accessing the Topic Maps engine directly applications may use a simple TMQL query. The architecture of Topic Maps applications is layered. The base of all applications are the Topic Maps backends, which are administrated by the Topic Maps engines. To abstract from the real implementation, TMAPI is used as a standardized interface. The last layer under the application is the TMQL4J engine.

==== Modularization ====

TMQL4J is designed as a process chain of simple modules. Each module provides a simple or atomic function in context of the querying process, like the lexical scanner. The configuration interface of TMQL4J offers the possibility to plug your own domain-specific implementations of some modules in.

==== Optimization ====

TMQL4J realizes an additional abstraction layer over the TMAPI and implements additional features to speed up the querying process by using new index implementations and extension of the TMAPI.

==== Omnigator Plug-in ====

As one of the first implementations, we provide a generic query plug-in for the Topic Maps browser Omnigator, called tmql4ontopia. It offers the possibility to query the Topic Maps using the TMQL syntax. The generic plug-in is an extension of TMQL4J
