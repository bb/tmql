=== The meta model of TMQL ===

The meta or data model of TMQL is quite different than the meta model of the topic maps ( TMDM ). There are many differences which are useful and show the different meanings and the huge discussion about the topic maps meta model. Currently the meta model of the query language includes concepts of the topic map reference model ( TMRM ) like the navigation concept which looks similar to the proxy concept of the reference model. Other import inputs are discussion about some changes of the topic maps meta model. As editors of the current draft some changes in context of the TMDM affected the current draft of the query language. 

This chapter tries to highlight the main differences between both conceptions the TMQL meta model on the one hand and the TMDM on the other hand.

==== No topic map construct ====

In contrast to the topic maps meta model the topic map construct can not access directly. So it it impossible to get all topics or all associations starting a navigation at the 'root' node. If we look at the topic map API ( TMAPI ) the 'root' node seems to be the topic map construct. As two main methods the topic map provides access to all topics and all associations. The TMAPI currently based on the TMDM conception.

The main problem of this drawback is the missing possibility to get this informations quite simple like it is supported by the TMAPI.

The concept of missing the direct addressing of the topic maps item is similar to the concept of the CTM syntax. A topic map will never addressed directly using a CTM pattern, it will represented indirectly as the whole document. In this case TMQL addresses the topic map item indirectly as the querying context. There is only one possibility to use the topic maps item in the context of a query, the environment variable '%_' representing the queried topic map. But there is no possibility to use it as navigation start point.

==== Merging the concept of names and occurrences ====

The topic maps meta model differs the two concepts of names and occurrences. Names are used as human readable identification of topic items. A name item representing a name of a subject of the real world and will be represented as a string literal. Occurrences representing the relationship of subjects and an information resource. An occurrence can be used to bind a characteristic information resource to the topic item including the occurrence, for example its email address or its date of birth.

In the context of information modeling the differences of names and occurrences are quite simple. Names can have variants and are always represented as a string literal which means names have the datatype 'string' any time. Occurrences have no variants and can have different datatypes, but also the datatype 'string'. Because of removing variants from the meta model, names and occurrence are quite the same except the datatype because of the fact that occurrences can be a string literal too, this difference has no relevance. As a result of this discussion the current draft of the topic maps query language does not differs between names and occurrences. Both concepts are merged to the concept of 'characteristics'. A characteristic item representing some relation of the topic item and an information resource which also can be a name, if the name type is used.
